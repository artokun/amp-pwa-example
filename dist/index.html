Then he told them, <span class="sup">8</span>"Go to Bethlehem and search for the child. And when you find him, come back and tell me so that I can go and worship him too!"</p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">9</span>After this interview the astrologers started out again. And look! The star appeared to them again, standing over Bethlehem. <span class="sup">10</span>Their joy knew no bounds!</p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">11</span>Entering the house where the baby and Mary his mother were, they threw themselves down before him, worshipping. Then they opened their presents and gave him gold, frankincense and myrrh. <span class="sup">12</span>But when they returned to their own land, they didn't go through Jerusalem to report to Herod, for God had warned them in a dream to go home another way.</p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">13</span>After they were gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. "Get up and flee to Egypt with the baby and his mother," the angel said, "and stay there until I tell you to return, for King Herod is going to try to kill the child." <span class="sup">14</span>That same night he left for Egypt with Mary and the baby, <span class="sup">15</span>and stayed there until King Herod's death. This fulfilled the prophet's prediction,</p><p class="quote__long">"I have called my Son from Egypt." <small>Hosea 11:1</small></p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">16</span>Herod was furious when he learned that the astrologers had disobeyed him. Sending soldiers to Bethlehem, he ordered them to kill every baby boy two years old and under, both in the town and on the nearby farms, for the astrologers had told him the star first appeared to them two years before. <span class="sup">17</span>This brutal action of Herod's fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah, <small>Jeremiah 31:15</small></p><p class="quote__long"><span class="sup">18</span>"Screams of anguish come from Ramah,</p><p class="quote__long">Weeping unrestrained;</p><p class="quote__long">Rachel weeping for her children,</p><p class="quote__long">Uncomforted--</p><p class="quote__long">For they are dead."</p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">19</span>When Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and told him, <span class="sup">20</span>"Get up and take the baby and his mother back to Israel, for those who were trying to kill the child are dead."</p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">21</span>So he returned immediately to Israel with Jesus and his mother. <span class="sup">22</span>But on the way he was frightened to learn that the new king was Herod's son, Archelaus. Then, in another dream, he was warned not to go to Judea, so they went to Galilee instead, <span class="sup">23</span>and lived in Nazareth. This fulfilled the prediction of the prophets concerning the Messiah,</p><p class="quote__long">"He shall be called a Nazarene."</p><h3 id="Matt3">Chapter 3</h3><a href="#Matthew">(back to chapter menu)</a><br><p class="quote">While they were living in Nazareth, John the Baptist began preaching out in the Judean wilderness. His constant theme was, <span class="sup">2</span>"Turn from your sins . . . turn to God . . . for the Kingdom of Heaven is coming soon." <span class="sup">3</span>Isaiah the prophet had told about John's ministry centuries before! He had written,</p><p class="quote__long">"I hear <small>Isaiah 40:3</small> a shout from the wilderness, 'Prepare a road for the Lord--straighten out the path where he will walk.'"</p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">4</span>John's clothing was woven from camel's hair and he wore a leather belt; his food was locusts and wild honey. <span class="sup">5</span>People from Jerusalem and from all over the Jordan Valley, and, in fact, from every section of Judea went out to the wilderness to hear him preach, <span class="sup">6</span>and when they confessed their sins, he baptized them in the Jordan River.</p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">7</span>But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to be baptized, he denounced them.</p><p class="quote">"You sons of snakes!" he warned. "Who said that you could escape the coming wrath of God? <span class="sup">8</span>Before being baptized, prove that you have turned from sin by doing worthy deeds. <span class="sup">9</span>Don't try to get by as you are, thinking, 'We are safe for we are Jews--descendants of Abraham.' That proves nothing. God can change these stones here into Jews!</p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">10</span>"And even now the axe of God's judgment is poised to chop down every unproductive tree. They will be chopped and burned.</p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">11</span>"With water I baptize those who repent of their sins; but someone else is coming, far greater than I am, so great that I am not worthy to carry his shoes! He shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. <span class="sup">12</span>He will separate the chaff from the grain, burning the chaff with never-ending fire, and storing away the grain."</p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">13</span>Then Jesus went from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized there by John. <span class="sup">14</span>John didn't want to do it.</p><p class="quote">"This isn't proper," he said. "I am the one who needs to be baptized by you."</p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">15</span>But Jesus said, <span class="jesus">"Please do it, for I must do all that is right."</span> So then John baptized him.</p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">16</span>After his baptism, as soon as Jesus came up out of the water, the heavens were opened to him and he saw the Spirit of God coming down in the form of a dove. <span class="sup">17</span>And a voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, and I am wonderfully pleased with him."</p><h3 id="Matt4">Chapter 4</h3><a href="#Matthew">(back to chapter menu)</a><br><p class="quote">Then Jesus was led out into the wilderness by the Holy Spirit, to be tempted there by Satan. <span class="sup">2</span>For forty days and forty nights he ate nothing and became very hungry. <span class="sup">3</span>Then Satan tempted him to get food by changing stones into loaves of bread.</p><p class="quote">"It will prove you are the Son of God," he said.</p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">4</span>But Jesus told him, <span class="jesus">"No! For the Scriptures tell us that bread won't feed men's souls: obedience to every word of God is what we need."</span></p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">5</span>Then Satan took him to Jerusalem to the roof of the Temple. <span class="sup">6</span>"Jump off," he said, "and prove you are the Son of God; for the Scriptures declare, 'God will send his angels to keep you from harm,' . . . they will prevent you from smashing on the rocks below."</p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">7</span>Jesus retorted, <span class="jesus">"It also says not to put the Lord your God to a foolish test!"</span></p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">8</span>Next Satan took him to the peak of a very high mountain and showed him the nations of the world and all their glory. <span class="sup">9</span>"I'll give it all to you," he said, "if you will only kneel and worship me."</p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">10</span> <span class="jesus">"Get out of here, Satan," <span>Jesus told him. </span>"The Scriptures say, 'Worship only the Lord God. Obey only him.'"</span></p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">11</span>Then Satan went away, and angels came and cared for Jesus.</p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">12,13</span>When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he left Judea and returned home to Nazareth in Galilee; but soon he moved to Capernaum, beside the Lake of Galilee, close to Zebulun and Naphtali. <span class="sup">14</span>This fulfilled Isaiah's prophecy:</p><p class="quote__long"><span class="sup">15,16</span>"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, beside the Lake, and the countryside beyond the Jordan River, and Upper Galilee where so many foreigners live--there the people who sat in darkness have seen a great Light; they sat in the land of death, and the Light broke through upon them." <small>Isaiah 9:1,2</small></p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">17</span>From then on, Jesus began to preach, <span class="jesus">"Turn from sin, and turn to God, for the Kingdom of Heaven in near."</span></p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">18</span>One day as he was walking along the beach beside the Lake of Galilee, he saw two brothers--Simon, also called Peter, and Andrew--out in a boat fishing with a net, for they were commercial fishermen.</p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">19</span>Jesus called out, <span class="jesus">"Come along with me and I will show you how to fish for the souls of men!"</span> <span class="sup">20</span>And they left their nets at once and went with him.</p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">21</span>A little farther up the beach he saw two other brothers, James and John, sitting in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets; and he called to them to come too. <span class="sup">22</span>At once they stopped their work and, leaving their father behind, went with him.</p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">23</span>Jesus traveled all through Galilee teaching in the Jewish synagogues, everywhere preaching the Good News about the Kingdom of Heaven. And he healed every kind of sickness and disease. <span class="sup">24</span>The report of his miracles spread far beyond the borders of Galilee so that sick folk were soon coming to be healed from as far away as Syria. And whatever their illness and pain, or if they were possessed by demons, or were insane, or paralyzed--he healed them all. <span class="sup">25</span>Enormous crowds followed him wherever he went--people from Galilee, and the Ten Cities, and Jerusalem, and from all over Judea, and even from across the Jordan River.</p><h3 id="Matt5">Chapter 5</h3><a href="#Matthew">(back to chapter menu)</a><br><p class="quote">One day as the crowds were gathering, he went up the hillside with his disciples and sat down and taught them there.</p><p class="quote"><span class="sup">3</span> <span class="jesus">"Humble men are very fortunate!" <span>he told them, </span>"for the Kingdom of Heaven is given to them. <span class="sup">4</span>Those who mourn are fortunate! for they shall be comforted. <span class="sup">5</span>The meek and lowly are fortunate! for the whole wide world belongs to them.</span></p><p class="jesus quote"><span class="sup">6</span>"Happy are those who long to be just and good, for they shall be completely satisfied. <span class="sup">7</span>Happy are the kind and merciful, for they shall be shown mercy. <span class="sup">8</span>Happy are those whose hearts are pure, for they shall see God. <span class="sup">9</span>Happy are those who strive for peace--they shall be called the sons of God. <span class="sup">10</span>Happy are those who are persecuted because they are good, for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.</p><p class="jesus quote"><span class="sup">11</span>"When you are reviled and persecuted and lied about because you are my followers--wonderful! <span class="sup">12</span>Be <em>happy</em> about it!

Let it shine for all; let your good deeds glow for all to see, so that they will praise your heavenly Father.</p><p class="jesus quote"><span class="sup">17</span>"Don't misunderstand why I have come--it isn't to cancel the laws of Moses and the warnings of the prophets. No, I came to fulfill them, and to make them all come true. <span class="sup">18</span>With all the earnestness I have I say: Every law in the Book will continue until its purpose is achieved. <span class="sup">19</span>And so if anyone breaks the least commandment, and teaches others to, he shall be the least in the Kingdom of Heaven.

Better for part of you to be destroyed than for all of you to be cast into hell. <span class="sup">30</span>And if your hand--even your right hand--causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away.

And don't swear 'By Jerusalem!' for Jerusalem is the capital of the great King. <span class="sup">36</span>Don't even swear 'By my head!' for you can't turn one hair white or black. <span class="sup">37</span>Say just a simple 'Yes, I will' or 'No, I won't.'

How right Isaiah was! <span class="sup">8</span>For you ignore God's specific orders and substitute your own traditions. <span class="sup">9</span>You are simply rejecting God's laws and trampling them under your feet for the sake of tradition.</p><p class="jesus quote"><span class="sup">10</span>For instance, Moses gave you this law from God; 'Honor your father and mother.'

To say that the Lord <em>is</em> some person's God means that person is <em>alive,</em> not dead!
